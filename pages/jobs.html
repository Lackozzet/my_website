            <p>
              As a dedicated Food & Beverage Assistant at Lviv Rebernya in Kyiv,
              I was integral in ensuring that each guest's dining experience was
              exceptional. In this dynamic role, my responsibilities included
              assisting in the preparation and presentation of food, maintaining
              strict hygiene standards, and managing inventory to ensure all
              necessary supplies were readily available.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              I played a key role in setting up for service, from arranging
              tables to decorating the dining area according to the day's theme
              or event requirements. I also provided direct customer service,
              warmly greeting guests, taking orders with accuracy, and
              addressing any dietary concerns or preferences, ensuring a
              personalized experience for each patron. My contributions were
              crucial in streamlining service operations and enhancing customer
              satisfaction through attentive service and a deep understanding of
              our menu offerings and the storied history of Lvivâ€™s culinary
              traditions.

            <br />

            <p>
              This role allowed me to develop strong teamwork skills, working
              collaboratively with kitchen staff and management to effectively
              meet service goals and respond to customer needs swiftly. My

              service management but also deepened my appreciation for the

            <p>
              As a dedicated member of the Festival Village team in the vibrant
              city of Edinburgh, I thrived in a dual role that spanned both
              front-of-house and financial transactions. My primary
              responsibilities included providing exemplary service as a waiter,
              where I ensured that every guest felt welcomed and valued. I
              efficiently managed the seating, order-taking, and food delivery
              processes, all while maintaining a friendly and professional
              demeanor.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              In my role as a cashier, I handled financial transactions with
              accuracy and speed, ensuring a seamless experience for customers
              during high-volume periods. My duties included processing
              payments, issuing receipts, and reconciling the cash drawer at the
              end of each shift, demonstrating my strong attention to detail and
              ability to manage financial responsibilities.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              Working in the bustling environment of Festival Village,
              especially during the Edinburgh Festival, taught me to thrive
              under pressure and adapt to diverse customer needs. This
              experience has honed my interpersonal and multitasking skills,
              making me a versatile and reliable team player in any dynamic

            <h2>Tattu</h2>
            <h3>Role: Food Runner, Expo, Waiter and Bartender</h3>
            <br />
            <img src="../jobs/tattu_edinburgh.jpg" alt="Tattu" />
            <p>
              During my tenure at Tattu, an esteemed contemporary Chinese
              cuisine restaurant in Edinburgh, I embraced a variety of roles
              that honed my versatility and understanding of the hospitality
              industry. My journey began as a Food Runner, where I was
              responsible for delivering dishes from the bustling kitchen to the
              patrons, ensuring that every plate arrived swiftly and precisely
              as intended by our chefs.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              Advancing to the role of Expo, I took on the pivotal task of being
              the last point of quality control before food presentation. This
              position demanded a keen eye for detail and the ability to
              coordinate between kitchen staff and front-of-house operations,
              guaranteeing that every dish met Tattu's high standards and that
              order sequences flowed seamlessly.
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              As a Waiter, I directly interacted with our guests, offering them
              personalized service that aimed not just to meet but exceed their
              dining expectations. My responsibilities included explaining menu
              details, making tailored recommendations, and ensuring a memorable
              dining experience by attentively managing their culinary journey
              from start to finish.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Finally, as a Bartender, I crafted signature cocktails and managed
              a diverse beverage service, combining mixology skills with an
              intimate knowledge of wine and spirits. This role required
              precision and creativity to deliver both classic and innovative
              drinks that perfectly complemented Tattuâ€™s unique dishes.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Throughout all these positions, my focus was on providing
              exemplary customer service, maintaining Tattu's sophisticated
              atmosphere, and contributing to our teamâ€™s continuous effort to
              redefine dining excellence.
